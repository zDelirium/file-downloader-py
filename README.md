# Python Shell File Downloader

**WIP**

## About

This Python program is supposed to be able to download multiple files using the shell *curl* command.

Developed on Python 3.7.3. Not sure about compatibility. But subprocess.run() needs Python 3.5 at least

Will decide later on the program flow and features.

## Use
1. Open shell in macOS or Linux
2. *python3 file_dwld.py* or *python file_dwld.py*
3. No user input for now

## Some dependencies
- macOS and Linux compatibility
- subprocess module
